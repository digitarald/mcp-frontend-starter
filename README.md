# üõ†Ô∏è MCP Frontend Starter

Explainer, playground and starter for using MCP[1] servers in VS Code with [GitHub Copilot's Agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode), focusing on frontend development for maximum "vibing"[2].

## Extend GitHub Copilot with MCP server tools

MCP support just landed in VS Code Insiders (v1.99) as preview feature, ready to be used with GitHub Copilot's Agent mode (see [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20MCP%20label%3Achat-mcp)). This allows you to use any MCP server in your agentic coding workflow.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a preview feature and may change in the future. Use at your own risk, but especially for fun and exploration! [File issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20MCP%20label%3Achat-mcp) if you find bugs or have suggestions.

### Getting Started with MCP

**Prerequisite**: Use VS Code Insiders (version 1.99 or later) with GitHub Copilot pre-release.

#### 1. Configure your MCP servers

1. Configure servers in `.vscode/mcp.json` to share with other developers working on the same project.
   1. `"servers": {}` follows Claude's structure for `claude_desktop_config.json`.
   2. `"inputs": []` optionally lets you define custom placeholders for the server configurations, to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
    ```jsonc
    // Example .vscode/mcp.json
    {
        // üí° Inputs will be prompted on first server start,
        //    then stored securely by VS Code.
        "inputs": [
            {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "perplexity-key",
            "description": "Perplexity API Key"
            }
        ],
        // Note, not "mcpServers"
        "servers": {
            // https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/
            "Perplexity": {
                "command": "docker",
                "args": [
                    "run",
                    "-i",
                    "--rm",
                    "-e",
                    "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY",
                    "mcp/perplexity-ask"
                ],
                "env": {
                    // Look ma, no hardcoded secrets!
                    "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${input:perplexity-key}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
2. Alternatively, configure `"mcp": {‚Ä¶}` to your VS Code settings to customize your personal MCP server list.
3. Enable MCP discovery in VS Code settings if you want to use your existing MCP entries from Claude Desktop.
    ```json
    "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true
    ```
4. Check command `MCP: List Servers` to see all available servers, easy access to start/stop and check the server *Output* for logs.

#### 2. Power up Copilot Agent Mode with MCP server tools

1. Open *Copilot Edits* view in VS Code, set to *Agent* mode.
2. Click the `üõ†Ô∏è` tools button to list enabled MCP tools (should list *Playwright*, *Memory*, *Perplexity*, ‚Ä¶)
   1. Servers/tools can be disabled/enabled
3. Try these prompts in agent mode:
   1. *"Research with perplexity what the best MCP servers for frontend development are"*
   2. *"Use the playwright tool to check that the waitlist input does email validation"*
   3. *"Change the design to a dark-only mode, and do a visual review with playwright"*

**Done!** It's that easy. But it's really just the beginning, as you will realize that *ANYTHING IN YOUR DEVELOPER TOOLBOX COULD BE AN MCP SERVER THAT PROVIDES TOOLS FOR GITHUB COPILOT*. ü§Ø Right?

### Next Steps

Things to try out:

- Add more MCP servers to `.vscode/mcp.json` from https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
- Enable/disable servers in the *Copilot Edits* view based on your task
- Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to fine-tune when and how tools are used
- Write your own MCP server in TypeScript, Python, or any other language

## Developing in this Starter

Easiest: Use *DevContainer* in VS Code for development. This will set up a local environment with all the necessary dependencies.

Or run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
